#Open Source Scientific Calculator
##An open-source alternative to standard school calculators

I was unsatisfied with the unhackability of our school-issued calculators,
so I decided to make my own. The OSSC.

Tasks ahead:
- [ ] write a comprehensive Readme
- [ ] add schematics
- [ ] make PCB's
- [ ] write code for the keypad
- [ ] write code for the Main Processing Unit
- [ ] design case
